Further inland is Ubud, a hill town known for its spa treatments, yoga and ecotourism, which may include a trip to a monkey preserve. Ringing the island are coral reefs teeming with sea life, making it a hot spot for scuba diving. You can also get a taste of Balinese culture at a gamelan percussion performance or one of thousands of Hindu temples, which feature intricate sculpture and regular festivals.",

Now the office of the provincial governor, it has a rooftop resembling the Indonesian skewered meat dish. There’s also the art deco mansion Villa Isola and the Sundanese-roofed Ceremonial Hall at the acclaimed Institut Teknologi Bandung.
